It is assumed that the mean systolic blood pressure is μ = 120 mm Hg. In the Honolulu Heart Study, a sample of 
n = 100 people had an average systolic blood pressure of 130.1 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 21.21 mm Hg.
Is the group significantly different from the regular population?

population mean:	μ = 120 
sample:			n = 100
sample mean: 		x̄ = 130.1  
sample st.dev.: 	σx̅ = 21.21 

Null hypothesis H0: 		Group is not significantly different from the regular population
Alternative hypothesis Ha:	Group is significantly different from the regular population

n is greater than 30 but the standard deviation for the population is unknown: t-test

1. Setting confidence level:	

	cf = 95%

2. Calculating test statistic for t-distribution: t = (x̄ - μ)/(σx̅/√n) 

	t = (130.1 - 120)/(21.21/√100)
	t = 10.1/0.2121
	t = 4.76

3. Calculating degree of freedom: df = n - 1

	df = 100 - 1
	df = 99

4. Checking critical value in the t-table (for 0,025 and df = 99): 

	tc = 1.984

5. Checking if t is in the allowed region
	
	t = 4.76
	tc = 1.984
	t > tc		

t is in the rejection zone; H0 is rejected, the group is signifficantly different from the population
